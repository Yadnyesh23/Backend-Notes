# Backend Development Notes 📘

This repository contains structured backend learning notes
that I am creating while studying backend development.

Currently, this serves as my personal study documentation
covering backend theory, concepts, and examples.

After completing the full backend roadmap, this repository
will be refined and released as an open-source resource
for students and developers.

⚠️ Note: Content is actively evolving and subject to change.
